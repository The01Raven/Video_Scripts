# New Year New Me

Welcome to the year 2025, whats your plan? Ain't that the question huh.
If you are anything like me, 2024 was a weird year, just like most of the years before. 2025 will probably be no different, especially if you don't change and do the things you want to do!
So I am sure you have a New Year's resolution right? Put a pin in that, I wanna talk about other things first.

## CheckPoints
I am sure you have stumbled onto a video like this. This has been refered to as an internet checkpoint. What's the point of an internet checkpoint, or hell, a checkpoint of anything?
We as people need to have moments where we reflect, and unless we are actively doing things to reflect, we end up attaching ourselves to seemingly significant, but ultimately meaningless, moments. 
That is what I believe the internet checkpoint is. It is a video that is odd, so you click, and then you are surronded by peopole also reflecting, so you join in.

The same can be said about New Years.

Now, I do not want to suggest that participation is meaningless, but rather that you can employ this specific kind of reflection anywhere and anytime. There is nothing special about an internet checkpoint or New Years resolution by itself, but rather the emphasis we as people put onto it. 

That emphasis is what we will use to plan out what we want to accomplish within a year. 

## Reflection
So now, let's take out some time to reflect on past years and ourselves. I wish for you to join in, but you need not comment if you do not want to.

Let's start with my college experience, my regrets and successes.

I lament the fact that I didn't interact enough in clubs and with my peers. I was graduating early so the pressure was there early on, but it seems like I still stayed in my shell. I will say, by the final semester, I managed to break free of it a little.
My attendance was also rather spotty, I think that is something I could have done a lot better on.
Now, we don't want this to be a case of us bashing ourselves. It is okay to have regrets and what you may call personal failings. It is important to recognize them, accept them, and embrace them. Sure I wish I made more friends, but I am here now.

Now let's look at positives, I learned alot, and became a better writer. I've become more well-read and I know what I must do to achieve my goals. And now I cannot think of much else... We tend to focus on negatives and not positives. I am still working on that myself.

Now, let's talk about my father, or rather his passing.
My father passed on January 1st 2023. It was super rough that year, and it's been super rough this year. I don't say this to want pity, but rather I want to talk about grief and how that interacts with your goals.

Grief can really damage your goals. It can reframe alot of your negative self talk, like what would so-and-so say about this or that. It can damage habits you've formed and create negative ones. This isn't to say that grief is wholly negative and that you need to do whatever you can to prevent it. Far from it, I think that you NEED to experience grief fully and take a pause from stuff without feeling guilty about it.

Secondly, grief sticks for a long time, and it may take a long time before you are able to start doing things again. I wish I had advice for how to deal with grief, but I do not feel like someone who can add input besides what I've said.

I will say that this grief allows me a unique look into reflection and New Year's that I will elaborate on in a bit.

What have I learned about Youtube and making videos? Firstly, I really enjoy it! Secondly, I need better time managenment. The second is fixable, the first is nice to hear. I swear I will get the Hacker Video done by January 31st, think of it as time to read it yourself. We will do it every month. Further, I would like to try live streaming, I will on youtube and twitch, so feel free to tune in!

Now, what is the purpose of reflection and why do we do it? It is more important then ever to take time out to reflect on what matters and what you want to do. This allows us to examine what our goals our and where we want to be. We can sepreate these into dreams, goals, and steps. Reflection helps us create our dreams, which is why I made this section so long. Through reflection, we can truly see what we wish to accomplish. Now, how do we achieve our goals?

## My goals and dreams
Let's walk through the steps using me as an example. As such, this will be a little less scripted. First, let's write down all of our dreams:

Now, let's identify the ones that will will regret if we didn't achieve them:

This is what we will set goals for:

Let's take the dream playing music. By the end of the year I would like 2-3 albums put out. I firstly want to further my study of music, so let's set January aside as a catching up period, and the rest of quarter one to learning. This will allow me to figure out what I need to focus on. At the end of Q1 I will reflect on how I performed and what next steps I need to take.

You can start to see how this planning works out. At the start of each year we plan our goals and what we want to hit. I want an album to be made at the end of Q2, Q3, and Q4. Q1 is focused on learning everything I need to achieve that. I plan what goals I want to hit each month of Q1, at the start of the month I plan what I want each week to look like. Each week I plan my goals for each day. Lastly, each day I plan out to achieve this. 

Importantly, each goal should be something you think is achievable in less time then you gave it. I want each quarter to be something I could get done in a month, and so-on. This should make each goal possible as we learn what we can get done in each section of time. It will also allow for unplanned obstacles. We tend to overestimate when we first start planning. It takes real reflection and understanding of oneself to be able to accurate plan without using cheats like this.

# Closing Remarks
