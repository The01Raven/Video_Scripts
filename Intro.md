# Why you should start a youtube channel? (Or why I'm starting)
More then 500 hours of video are uploaded to youtube a day. So why should you?

That is what rings in my head whenever I think about making a youtube video. Why should I?
I do not think I am any special, in fact I think I am quite regular and boring. 
When I look at the vast array of content posted onto the web at anytime I am intimidated. I want to join in, but I am viscously scared that, when I do, I'll be met with nothing. It's so much safer to hold back, to make sure that I am protected.
But then I wonder, why?
(The script is uploaded to Github as a Markdown file, shoutouts to https://www.youtube.com/@lrnjulie for the idea.)

## Me, me, me.
I am a person who is terrified to show myself to anyone. 
I try to avoid talking to anyone, scared to show my ideas, just plain terrified of everything. I say to myself, "This is fine."

But it really isn't.

I imagine there are tons of people out there like me, who want to try to run it solo. "I can do it myself."

But that is not how life is. That's not how it works. Collaboration is how we move forward, it's how we do... everything!

Then again what do I know...

Why did I decide to finally start is the best question, it's because I am about to graduate college. I figured, "What can I lose?"
I see so many people who are still in school doing youtube, or I see adults who *seem* to have their life together. 

Where are the 20 somethings who just want to talk while they figure out jobs or grad school or anything else. I don't see them. They probably exist, but I wouldn't know. 
So I wanted to through my hat into the ring. Why not join the discussion?

I am a creative at heart, so let me show it!
## What are my Goals?
It is my belief that setting goals is one of the best things when creating a long-term project such as this. Goals help us stay focused on what we want. Sometimes they change, but when we do change our goals, its always within the context of the old goals. 
So let's go over mine here.

### 1. Upload every week
I want to upload every week. I can see how this goal may seem lofty, but I am not going to try to upload a nice full 10 minute video every week. One week it may be a simple 2 minute video of me talking about my day. No matter, if I really wanna try, then this will be my goal. 

I do have a strategy though. I will be talking about a book every week and sharing it with you all. This is one of the best ways to gain knowlege, writing about what you've learned. As such, the book I will be reading this next week will be *A Hacker's Manifesto*. If you can, I encourage you to join me and write a comment about your thoughts. 

If any of y'all have ideas I would love to see them!
### 2. Maintain a blog
So why am I writing about a blog while trying to maintain youtube? Because I want to do both. I view a blog as an easy way to write smaller things here and there, or go more in depth on a certain topic I covered on my youtube channel. My goal with my videos is to have them be concise and focused. Blogs can be a little more lengthy and wordy in my opinion. Either way, I will be maintaining both and will have it uploaded in the description. 

### 3. Create Discussion
This is where I promise you all that I will try to avoid creating inflamatory or drama ridden content. I do not have the time to get overly invested into drama and neither do y'all. This does not mean I will never dip my toe into drama or angry content, but rather that I will not go out of my way to create it.
I believe when we look at the state of many channels, we see a slow descent into drama, into ragebait, but that is the last thing I wish to do. 
Being mad is one thing, but creating rage is a whole nother.

So, what I want to do is create discussion. This will manifest in a few things. One, I will try to jump into comments often. Two, I will delete comments that are either spammy, or are trying to stir drama. Again, anger is fine, but I want to have talks.

This ties back in with collaboration. If all I do is sit on my thoughts and never share them, I will never grow. I want good and strong ideas, so it is important to colaborate. 

I may also eventually create a discord, but that is a future me problem.

### 4. Short Term
These goals will be maintained until December 31st, at which I will look over my goals and my successes and failures and decide to what degree I wish to continue. So, if you want me to keep at it (on a regular basis) then engage with my content!

### 5. Other notes
All my scripts will be uploaded to Github as a Markdown file (taking inspiration from *NoBoilerPlate*). If you use any of my content make sure to credit me in a very clear fashion (I.E. don't drop a credit in a random comment, make it clear). 
I also have a Ko-Fi and a Patreon if you wish to give me money. I really appreciate it and it is the best way to show your support. 

## Conclusion
So why should you make a youtube channel?
Because we want to explore ideas and learn. To be honest, you don't even have to make a youtube channel, I just believe we should all try to create stuff. Leave the world in a better place then we left it y'know?
If you do end up making a channel because of this video, let me know and give me a shoutout. I would love to see what your working on!
